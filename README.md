## Playing Quirate

- At the home page, login or register.
- If you've never played before, go to 'Add Deck' to make your first deck of flashcards.
- Go to "View Cards" to make new cards for your deck.  As you add them they'll show up here.  Come here anytime you want to add, delete or edit the questions on cards in this deck. 
- When you're ready to play simply press  "Play a Deck" and you're ready to become a Quizard!
- First you'll see the question.  When you think you know the answer, click on the card and it will flip over to show you the answer.  
- Did you get it right?  If so press âœ”, if not press X. As you go from card to card check how you're doing on the counter.  
- You can only answer a card once.  Don't worry, you can play this deck over and over until you know it all. 
- After you've answered all your cards, check your score.  If you want to play that deck again hit the "Reset Deck" and you've got another chance to get them all right.  
- When you've mastered that deck go to "Home" and pick another deck to play.  You can also add decks and cards from here. 
- After you're all done learning, logout and go show everyone what a Quizard you are!
